# To execute a bash script, you must also provide instructions on how to
# reverse its actions.

bash
  echo 'Hello world' > ~/hello.txt
  ln -s ~/hello.txt /etc/foo/bar.txt
@undo
  unlink /etc/foo/bar.txt
  rm ~/.hello.txt
endbash

# In practice, though, serv tries to reduce the amount of custom
# shell scripts you will need to write.
